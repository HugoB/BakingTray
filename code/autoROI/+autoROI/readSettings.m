function settings = readSettings(readFromYaml)
    % Read settings (from a yaml file if desired)
    % 
    % function settings = readSettings(readFromYaml)
    %
    % Purpose
    % Returns settings that are used by other functions. Some settings
    % are shared by multiple functions and need to be passed about. 
    % Having this settings file ensures that we don't pass around 
    % values and maybe lose track of them. 
    %
    % Inputs
    % readFromYaml - if true, reads from a yaml file located in the same dirctory
    %                as this read function. 
    %
    % TODO - currently we aren't using the YAML-reading option.
    %
    % Outputs
    % settings - A structure containing settings that read by other functions.
    %            More information on what these settings are can be found in 
    %            comments in-line with the code.
