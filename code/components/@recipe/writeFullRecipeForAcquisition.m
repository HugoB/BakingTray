    % Write recipe to disk and name it according to the sample ID and today's date

    %
    % Purpose
    % Turns all the public properties of the recipe class into a structure containing
    % their current values and writes this to disk in the current directory as a file
    % named: "recipe_SAMPLENAME_YYMMDD.yml" This operation is performed at the start
    % of data acquisition in order to record the parameters with whihc the acquisition
    % was performed. The purpose of this method is to create a recipe file that can be
    % used to run, re-run, or re-start a specific acquisition.
    %
    % 
    % Inputs
    % dirName - By default the recipe is written to the current directory. If dirName
    %           is defined, the recipe is written here instead. 
    %
    % Outputs
    % Optionally return the full path to the file location
    %
    %
    % Also see:
    %  recipe.saveRecipe
