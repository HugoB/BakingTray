    % Purpose
    % The preview stack (pStack) is a structure that contains an average of 
    % all depths in the last preview image. If the preview image contains
    % multiple channels, this method finds the one with the greatest range
    % and returns only that.
    %
    % Details on what the preview stack is are here:
    %  https://github.com/raacampbell/autofinder/issues/61

    % Log the front/left stage position when this preview image was obtained. This information is 
    % recorded by the method BT.initialisePreviewImageData, which stores it in BT.frontLeftWhenPreviewWasTaken

    % For autoROI stacks it will vary by section.
