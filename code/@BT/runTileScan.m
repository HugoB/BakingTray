    % The method moves the sample to the front/left position, initialises some variables
    % then initiates the scan cycle. This method is called by BT.bake.

    runSuccess=false;


    % Create the position array
    [pos,indexes]=obj.recipe.tilePattern;
    obj.positionArray = [indexes,pos,nan(size(pos))]; %We will store the stage locations here as we go

    % Move to the front left position
    obj.setXYvelocity(obj.recipe.SYSTEM.xySpeed)
    obj.toFrontLeft;

    % Set up stages for the acquisition type.
    % Also set up triggering on line 1 of the Y stage if we're doing a ribbon scan. Otherwise disable it.
    % The scanner-specific changes that need to be made will have been implemented in the scaner itself (e.g. in SIBT)
    % by the armScanner method

        case 'tile'
            %obj.yAxis.disableInMotionTrigger(1,2) % TODO: temporarily disable. Not all stages do this.

        case 'ribbon'
            obj.yAxis.enableInMotionTrigger(1,2); %To produce the triggers we need to scan from 
            R = obj.scanner.returnScanSettings;

            yRange = range(pos(:,2));
            timeToImageLines = R.linesPerFrame * R.linePeriodInMicroseconds * 1E-6;

    %TODO: ensure the acquisition is stopped before we proceed

    % Concept
    % We can't run the tile scan in an explicit for loop because we need to trigger the next frame
    % *immediately* after the acquisition of the current frame. So this needs to be an event
    % triggered by a listener that's monitoring the notifier which fires when the frame has been
    % acquired. So the events that handle the next frame will be triggered by the callback function
    % we attach to frameAcquired in ScanImage. We just have to initiate the first frame here, then
    % the acquisition process will continue until all frames have been acquired. 

    startTime=now;

    % Instruct the scanner to initiate the tile scan. This may simply involving issuing a trigger if tile scanning
    % or will initiate a motion that will itself trigger if ribbon scanning.
    obj.scanner.initiateTileScan; %acquires a stack and triggers the scanner (likely ScanImage) to acquire the rest of the stacks

    %block until done
